# Encryption/Decryption Project
Encryption &amp; Decryption Project that I coded in my ITSS 4381 course. 

## Summary

This Python script provides a simple implementation of a substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages. It utilizes the `random` and `string` modules to create a shuffled key for substitution.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter a message to encrypt when prompted.
3. The script will display both the original and encrypted messages.
4. For decryption, enter the encrypted message when prompted.
5. The script will then display the decrypted message.

## Example

```python
chars: [list of characters used for encryption]
key : [shuffled list of characters]

Enter a message to encrypt: [user-input]
original message: [user-input]
encrypted message: [corresponding encrypted message]

Enter a message to decrypt: [user-input]
encrypted message: [user-input]
original message: [corresponding decrypted message]
